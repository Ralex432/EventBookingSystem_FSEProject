**Methodology chosen:** <br />
We opted for the Waterfall methodology which is a linear project management approach that breaks down the activities 
into sequential phases. The choice was backed up by the reduced size of our project and the clear requirements that 
existed from the very beginning. Therefore, a project where each step depends only on the previous one and no "revisiting" of
anterior phase is needed can be easily approached using the waterfall model.
